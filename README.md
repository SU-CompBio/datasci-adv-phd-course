# Advanced data science and programming course

## General information

Semmelweis University - 2021 spring course on data science, programming,
advanced data analysis, including sequencing data analysis, using command line
tools, R and Python with lecture outlines, recommended reading material and
other information.

The course builds heavily on the [Carpentries
Foundation](https://carpentries.org) material and teaching philosophy. This
version is intended for people with already some experience using R and Python
to do basic data analysis and visualization.

**Location**: Histology Seminar Room (ground floor), Semmelweis University,
1<sup>st</sup> Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, H-1085
Budapest, Üllői út 26. The IRL class might or might not happen, depending on the
pandemic.

**Network**: Use the `HISTOLOGY-1` or `HISTOLOGY-2` wireless networks, and ask
the teachers for password.

**Time**: every Wednesday, from 16:30 to 18:00, starting with the 3<sup>rd</sup>
of February for 14 weeks.

**Requirements**: participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows
operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative
privileges on. They are also required to abide by the [Carpentries Code of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

**Grading and homeworks**: there are going to be 12 short homework exercises (no
homework for Week 1 and Week 14), where you will be asked to think about a
problem, try to solve it, and most importantly, document your thoughts, the
issues or problems you ran into. You will need to submit one or a few small text
files, tables, documents, or scripts through Dropbox File Requests. We are going
to discuss solutions and issues next week. You will need to submit at least 6 of
them to pass, and 10 for excellent. Keep in mind that you are here to learn and
try things out. Active participation, discussing issues and asking questions is
much more important, than submitting perfectly written programming exercises.

**Contact**: send an email to sebestyen.endre at med dot semmelweis-univ dot hu
if you have any questions or comments.

**Teachers**: Endre Sebestyén, Bence Szalai, Gábor Turu, Miklós Cserző

**Online setup**: The course will be shared on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), and the
classes will be recorded. This way, you can join and follow the material even if
you are abroad, in quarantine, have another class at the same time, etc.

If you haven't used Zoom before, go to the official website to download and
install the Zoom client for your computer.

Like other Carpentries workshops, you will be learning by "coding along" with
the teachers. To do this, you will need to have both the window for the tool you
will be learning about (a terminal, RStudio, your web browser, etc..) and the
window for the Zoom video conference client open. In order to see both at once,
we recommend using one of the following set up options:

- **Two monitors**: If you have two monitors, plan to have your terminal or
  RStudio up on one monitor and the video conferencing software on the other.

- **Two devices**: If you don't have two monitors, do you have another device
  (tablet, smartphone) with a medium to large sized screen? If so, try using the
  smaller device as your video conference connection and your larger device
  (laptop or desktop) to follow along with code examples and instructions.

- **Divide your screen**: If you only have one device and one screen, practice
  having two windows (the video conference program and one of the tools you will
  be using at the workshop) open together. How can you best fit both on your
  screen? Will it work better for you to toggle between them using a keyboard
  shortcut? Try it out in advance to decide what will work best for you.

The course will be recorded on Zoom automatically. Ask the teachers for a link,
if you missed class, or want to check the examples, explanations, etc again.

includes detailed information on how to set up your screen to follow along
during the course.

## Week 1 - 2021-02-03

*Introduction, software setup, basics of command-line.*

Delivery plan:

- Explain content of course
- Explain Code of Conduct
- Homeworks and grading
- Short introduction from everybody
- Getting started with the iPython terminal

During this lesson we will do some introduction, setup and then learn about the
Unix shell. We will discuss how to work in a shell, why is it useful and learn
some basic commands.

An iPython browser-based terminal, is accessible
[here](https://10.114.112.81:4040). This address can be only seen from inside
the Semmelweis University network or by [using a
VPN](https://semmelweis.hu/informatika/egyeb-szolgaltatasok/eroforrasok-tavoli-elerese/).
More details during the course.

We will use the Software Carpentry lesson titled [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

- [Introducing the Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/index.html)
- [Navigating Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html)
- and finally, as far as we can progress in [Working With Files and
  Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)

### Recommended readings

- [Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/)
- [GNU Manuals Online](http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html)
- [GNU Manuals Online - coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html)
- The Unix shell at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)
